The assistant states that the total number of possible outcomes is 36, which is correct, but then incorrectly assumes that all of these outcomes satisfy the condition of having a total number at least 3.\n\nThe correct calculation would be to count the number of successful outcomes (where the total number is at least 3) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the number of successful outcomes is 35 (36 - 1 - 0) and the total number of possible outcomes is 36, resulting in a probability of 35/36.\n\nAside from this mistake, the assistant's explanation of the possible outcomes and combinations is accurate and the method used to find the probability is correct.\n\nRating: [[8]]",
