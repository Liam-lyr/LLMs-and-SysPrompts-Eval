Additionally, the assistant incorrectly stated that the investment amount in the third year was $40,048, which is unrelated to the question.\n\nThe correct answer is that the startup invested $8000 in software development in the first year and half of that amount, $4000, in the second year.

So, we can represent the number as 10x + 4, where x is an integer.\nWhen twice this number (2 * (10x + 4)) is divided by 4, we can simplify it as follows:\n2 * (10x + 4) = 20x + 8 = 4 * (5x + 2) + 0\n\nTherefore, the remainder when twice the number is divided by 4 is 0.\n\nRating: [[2]]",
