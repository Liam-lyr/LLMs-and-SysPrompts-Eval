The correct calculation involves finding the length of the base and the height of the triangle, which are perpendicular to each other. The base can be determined by finding the distance between the points (-1, 1) and (3, 3), and the height can be determined by finding the distance between the point (0, 0) and the line containing the base. \n\nThe assistant's answer uses the Law of Cosines to find the included angle and then the formula for the area of a triangle, which is incorrect for this particular question.\n\nThe correct calculation should be as follows:\n\nBase: Distance between (-1, 1) and (3, 3) = sqrt((3 - (-1))^2 + (3 - 1)^2) = sqrt(16 + 4) = sqrt(20) = 2sqrt(5)\n\nHeight: Distance between the line containing the base and the point (0, 0) = 0\n\nTherefore, the area of the triangle is 1/2 * base * height = 1/2 * 2sqrt(5) * 0 = 0.\n\nRating: [[2]]",

Then, we need to subtract the percentage of students who like both colors (22%) twice, as they were included twice in the initial sum:\n\n1 - (58% + 45% - 22% - 22%) = 1 - 79% = 21%\n\nSo, the correct probability is 21%.\n\nRating: [[3]]",
