It starts by incorrectly stating that the number of people boarding at the first station is equal to the total number of people boarding at the starting station minus the number of people alighting at the first station. It then proceeds to calculate the number of people boarding at the second station based on this incorrect assumption. The final result it provides, 30 people, is also incorrect.\n\nCorrection: \nTo solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let's assume the total number of people boarding at the starting station is x. According to the given information, at the first station, half of the people alight, so the number of people boarding at the first station would be x/2 + 4 (because 4 people boarded the bus at this station). At the second station, 6 people alight, so the number of people boarding at the second station would be (x/2 + 4) + 8 (because 8 people boarded the bus at this station). We can set up the equation: (x/2 + 4) + 8 = 25. By solving this equation, we can find the value of x, which represents the number of people boarding at the starting station.\n\nThe correct answer is 38 people.\n\nRating: [[2]]",
